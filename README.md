# agentstats

agentstats is a command-line tool for inspecting AI coding agent usage.
It aggregates local history and reports session, tool, and skill usage.

[日本語版 / Japanese](README.ja.md)

> [!NOTE]
> agentstats supports:
> - Codex local history (default)
> - [ctx](https://github.com/ctxrs/ctx) event stream

### Tool usage

Show calls, failures, and last-used times by canonical tool name.

```sh
agentstats tools
```

```text

1 tool, 42 calls total
```

### Common options

- `--source` selects the history source. Codex local history is the default;
  use `--source ctx` for the ctx event stream. Each invocation reads one source
  only.
- `--days N` limits the report to the last N days.
- `--from YYYY-MM-DD` and `--to YYYY-MM-DD` select an inclusive UTC calendar-date range; either option may be used alone. They cannot be combined with `--days`.
- `Period` shows the date range of the data actually included in the aggregation.
- `--json` emits machine-readable output.

## Skill usage details

### Skill usage fields

`agentstats skills` reports the following fields:

| Dimension | Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activation mode | `Explicit` | An explicit skill request or invocation was observed, such as `$skill-name` or a structured Skill call. |
| Activation mode | `Implicit` | Usage inferred from runtime access to a skill's `SKILL.md` or scripts without an explicit request. |
| Activation mode | `Unknown` | Skill evidence was found, but the history does not reveal whether activation was explicit or implicit. |
| Evidence state | `Confirmed` | The history contains direct evidence that the skill instructions or a skill item/tool was loaded or invoked. |
| Evidence state | `Inferred` | Usage inferred from runtime file or script access. |
| Evidence state | `Unconfirmed` | An explicit request was observed, but no confirming evidence was found. |
| Summary | `Total` | Deduplicated usage count: once per turn by default, or once per session with `--group-by session`. |

Activation mode and evidence state are independent. A single usage can have evidence for more than one activation mode, so the mode counts do not always add up to `Total`. `--strict` includes only `Confirmed` usage.

### Choosing a skill usage view

Choose the Skill usage view with `--view`:

```sh
agentstats skills --view compact  # Total only
agentstats skills --view mode     # Activation mode
agentstats skills --view state    # Evidence state
agentstats skills --view all      # Both tables
```

The default `--view auto` selects `compact`, `mode`, or `all` from the terminal width.

### Finding unused skills

Use `--unused` with `skills` to compare the selected history source with the
installed skill inventory:

```sh
agentstats skills --unused
```

Inventory identity is the canonical skill name plus its absolute physical path.
Therefore, same-name skills at different paths are shown as separate rows when
the name is unused. Usage matching remains canonical-name based: if any selected
ctx agent used a name, all inventory rows with that name are considered used.

## Cache

Parsed results are cached in the OS-standard user cache directory to speed up
subsequent runs.

## Data handling

agentstats reads Codex history or ctx's public read-only event stream and never
modifies the selected data. It does not send history externally, and normal
reports do not include prompt text, command text, or other raw event details.
